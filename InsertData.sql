        renewed. His ambition to play for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar later this year still burns strong, while his
        recent performances at the heart of the Chelsea back three have oozed class and composure.Most notably, the defenders reading of the game has been impressive, allowing him to operate a step ahead of opposition forwards, an attribute he believes has been developed after years spent playing at the highest level in Italy, France and on the international stage./<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/chelsea-production/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_360,z_1.0/v1/editorial/news/2022/03/08/Thiago_Silva_DAZ_1341">
        What makes life easier at the back for Thiago Silva is the relentless work in midfield from team-mates like
        Kante hassling and harrying the opposition in possession. He feels this is an underestimated part of the game,
        work that goes largely unnoticed by many but makes a big difference for defenders like him.
        I run more from one side to the other, even as part of a back three, but often I win the ball back because these
        players put good pressure on the opponent in possession.
        Norwich are the leagues bottom side and were beaten 7-0 earlier in the season at Stamford Bridge. However,
        Thiago Silva is adamant league position and points matter little when preparing for a game in the Premier

        on the bench and Andreas Christensen and Mateo Kovacic coming into the side.

        The momentum from that 4-0 win rolled over into this one. There were only two minutes on the clock when we took
        the lead against the bottom-placed club, Chalobah doing again what he has shown he is capable of this season –
        causing damage at a set-piece. On this occasion the young central defender barely needed to jump to get the
        better of his marker Joshua Sargent at the near post and score. Mount had delivered the corner.
        The fast start continued when Kai Havertz had a shot saved by Tim Kruls legs and another Mount corner caused
        Canary panic.;<img

        With 12 minutes played, Havertz had another on-target effort saved after he had swivelled sharply, but we only
        needed to wait another minute for the scoreline to double. Havertz squared the ball, Mount slipped away sideways
        from the closest defender and rifled a shot high into the net. That one was unsaveable! A great way for Mason to
        end his three-month wait for a goal.
        Norwich did work Mendy on 20 minutes but he caught defender Christoph Zimmermanns shot with both hands. That was
        the home sides only shot on target in the first half. Mount on the volley cleared the crossbar when play quickly

        Just like at Burnley on Saturday, this was an away game of contrasting fortunes either side of the interval for
        the Blues, albeit in reverse from the action at Turf Moor. Whereas Thomas Tuchels side were reinvigorated after
        the break in Lancashire, this outing saw us start brightly out of the blocks and race into a two-goal lead
        inside 15 minutes.

        It was the first time we had established such an advantage at that stage of a game since our 4-1 win at Crystal
        Palace last April and it set the tone for a first half in which we had 73 per cent possession and 10 shots
        compared to Norwichs two.

        Mount and Havertz combined for half of those efforts on goal, ending the first 45 minutes with a goal and two
        assists between them, before the German went on to net our third late in the game, the first time this season

        With Christian Pulisic missing out through illness, there was a place in the starting line-up for Timo Werner on
        the left, although much of our attacking was sent down the opposite flank, with Cesar Azpilicueta (in for Reece
        James before his withdrawal at half-time) operating much higher than fellow wing-back Saul.

        Havertz and Mount also lent towards to that side of the pitch, with an attack from that area proving key in our
        late third goal. In fact, 40 per cent of our attacking was directed down the right.;<img
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/chelsea-production/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_360,z_1.0/v1/editorial/news/2022/03/11/debrief-vs-norwich-mount-stats">
        Mount loves playing with the Canaries and so it proved again in Norfolk as the midfielder scored and assisted in
        a generally impressive all-round performance. He has now scored more goals against Norwich than he has against
        any other side in his career, with six in five matches.

        The 23-year-old netted a hat-trick against them earlier in the season and scored his first ever Chelsea away
        goal at Carrow Road in August 2019 so it was no surprise he started the game with confidence and commitment
        right from the start.
        He successfully retrieved possession on four occasions and won the same number of duels, while on the ball his
        game-high 30 passes in the final third helped create five chances for the Blues and four shots for himself, both
        also unmatched in the contest. The one that went in, teed up by Havertz, was his first since mid-December and
        his 25th for the club.

        After claiming in his post-match interviews that the players had found it difficult to focus at times this week
        due to off-field distractions, there was certainly no evidence of that in the midfielders eye-catching
        performance.; <img

        While Havertz and Mount were able to cause problems at one end of the field, Thiago Silvas reassuring presence
        at the back once again provided the foundations from which the whole team built.

        The Brazilian claimed an incredible 11 per cent ball possession just by himself, had 133 touches and completed
        94 per cent of his 122 attempted passes, all game-high figures by some distance.Similarly, only Trevoh Chalobah
        matched his five clearances as the veteran defender showed the other side of his game in the second half when
        Norwich upped their attacking intent.

        Despite conceding from the spot to spoil our clean sheet, we still have the second-best defensive record in the
        Premier League this season (19 goals conceded in 27 games). That has also helped extend our lead over
        fifth-placed Manchester United to nine points with a game in hand.',6)

That means the German has tasted defeat in both his Wembley finals with the Blues, following last seasons FA Cup showpiece against Leicester City. However, he insists his desire to return is based purely on the chance to be part of such big games again, and not on any feelings of unfinished business, as he feels we need to put our emotions to one side and take the competition one challenge at a time.;
We want to go back and of course as soon as possible, said Tuchel. If you want to reach the top of the mountain you need to go from base camp to base camp. The next step is Luton. As boring as it may sound, we cannot waste any energy with feelings of revenge or feelings that we have to still prove something.','<img

        He also underlined the fact that he considers both of those previous Wembley finals as positive experiences
        despite ending on the losing side, as they merely whet his appetite for more.;

        Of course its always like this, but the experiences, both of them were great. The first one, as a German coach
        to be in an FA Cup final, so full of history, was brilliant. The last match was even better because it was a
        full stadium with the crowd and the match we played was even more satisfying.;

        It will stick with me as a very positive memory because Im happy with how we played it and that I had the
        chance to be part of it. And of course were addicted to it, everybody is in high-level sports. Once youve
        tasted it you want to have more.;
        Tuchel continued to explain why he was not left downhearted by Sundays shoot-out loss to Liverpool, due to how
        his team performed at Wembley, but refused to be drawn on whether he felt we need to secure more silverware, in
        addition to the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, to consider our 2021/22 campaign a success.;
        I will never stop loving this game that we played. If we win a title, we win a title. If we dont win a title I
        cannot jump off a building. As long as we play like this, with full commitment and quality in games like this, I
        am a happy coach.;
        Can I guarantee titles? No, I never did. At the end of the season it is the end of the season, then we will talk
        about it. In the middle of a marathon we cannot ask the people if they are happy if they stay in this place,
        because nobody knows if they stay in this place.;
        So lets see at the end of the race and then we can talk about the race and if we are happy with the outcome. In

        centre of our back three, and the 26-year-old admits it wasnt a switch he had been expecting until very
        recently.;

        It came as a surprise to me! I found out the day before that I might have to do a job there. A lot of our
        defenders have got niggles and theres some players who played 120 minutes plus penalties at the weekend.;

        You have to do a job where you get put and I still tried to bring my qualities and what makes me Loftus-Cheek
        to the game. Thats all I could do but I really enjoyed it.;

        I played centre-back when I was 12 or 13, for a season or two, and I never liked it! But tonight was a bit
        different, I played as a centre-back in a back four when I was younger. This time I had more licence to step out

        He certainly managed to contribute plenty to our attacking play despite being positioned at the heart of our
        defence, including providing the weighted pass that played in Timo Werner for the second of our two equalisers,
        although Loftus-Cheek was quick to hand the credit to the striker.;

        I had a lot of time on the ball and no-one was pressuring me, he added. So I looked up and Timo was pointing
        in behind and I just tried to pick him out. I think it was a great touch and a great finish from Timo, so credit

        slotting into the centre-back.;
        Kenedy made his first appearance since returning from loan in January on the left flank, with Callum Hudson-Odoi
        returning on the right. That meant a completely fresh midfield pairing of Saul Niguez alongside the evenings
        captain Jorginho.;
        The second player to keep their place from the weekend was Mason Mount, with forwards Timo Werner and Romelu
        Lukaku both being introduced in the front three, after impressing from the bench at Wembley.;

        The game didnt start in the best fashion for Chelsea, as we found ourselves going behind in the matchs first
        piece of goalmouth action.;
        It came following a scrappy opening, when a couple of loose passes from Hudson-Odoi and Mount, followed by a
        hopeful long-ball from Luton, resulted in a corner for the home team. That was when disaster struck for the
        Blues, as the set-piece was headed across goal by defender Reece Burke, bouncing in off the inside of the back
        post, giving Kepa no chance as we went behind just two minutes in.;
        Cheered on by their fans, sat right on the touchline in a tight Kenilworth Road, the Hatters continued to make a
        bright start, finding space down the left, but Kepa wasnt troubled again in the first 10 minutes.;
        At that point, there was a lengthy pause in play after Luton goalkeeper Jed Steer went down under no challenge
        when coming off his line to collect a cross ahead of Lukaku. It appeared to be a serious ankle injury as he left
        the field on a stretcher, with a word of consolation from Kepa, to be replaced by substitute Harry Isted.;

        A quick attack starting with Kepa, after another dangerous Luton corner, gave Werner the chance to open up his
        stride and run at the home defenders, cutting across the edge of the box from the right.;
        The German stumbled as he went past the second man, but Saul was charging in to take over and place a perfect
        first-time shot into the bottom corner with his less-favoured right foot. That meant our No17 had scored his
        first goal for the club on his 17th appearance for the Blues.;
        With the scores back level, Chelsea were firmly in the ascendancy that many had expected from the start against
        our Championship opposition. That resulted in further chances too, as Saul was disappointed not to get his
        second Chelsea goal when breaking free inside the box, but Isted managed to save with his feet at the near post.
        Soon afterwards, Isted produced an even better save to tip a powerful Kenedy drive around the post.;',2)

After an excellent pre-season, the defender has now made 22 appearances so far in 2021/22, including a solid 120-minute performance in Sundays cup final, after which he was left requiring stitches in the dressing room following Naby Keitas late tackle.;
The 22-year-old lined up alongside Thiago Silva at Wembley and has discussed his admiration for a defensive colleague he never imagined he would one day be sharing a pitch with.;

        Chalobah also outlined what boss Thomas Tuchel said to him after he scored on his Premier League debut against
        Crystal Palace on the opening day of the season.;

        When the manager spoke to me after Palace, he said you need to stay with the likes of Thiago, Azpi and Rudiger
        to learn from them he added. Ive done the games, Ive done the experience and now it is time to learn from
        the senior players. Sharing the pitch with them is where I want to be.;

        Azpilicueta always speaks to me. You know how many games he has played now, he tells me to look after my body.

        One other defender who has had a strong influence on Trevohs transition to the mens first-team squad is
        Antonio Rudiger, who Trevoh says is one of the most supportive and motivational players in the dressing room.;

        He is also from Sierra Leone so when he first came [to the club] my brother told him to look after me,
        Chalobah revealed. I used to go round to his house and we chilled. Every time he came over for training, he
        always got hold of me and helped me.;

        He was the only one that season that believed in me and told me to keep going. The next year, I ended up going
        on loan maybe three times, and after every season he was telling me to keep going and saying “I know you are
        good enough to play for this club” and he just kept me going.;',4)

        The focus is so huge that it is a big thing, but one example is that maybe Jorginho goes through a little bit of
        similar dip of recent form, of freshness, and I can absolutely understand that because Ive over-used Jorgi

Reds goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher made a series of saves to keep things goalless, especially in denying Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic either side of half-time.;

There was also controversy surrounding the officials, as they failed to punish Naby Keita for a studs-up challenge that caught Trevoh Chalobah at waist height, as well as disallowing four goals over the course of the match. The first was by Liverpool following an already soft free-kick, but the next three were all Chelsea. Havertz was denied twice by the linesmans flag but the most controvesial was when Lukaku broke free and turned his marker before slotting in from close range, with VAR failing to intervene again, despite replays appearing to show the Belgian level.;

That meant the game went all the way to penalties and, after the first 10 players on each side had found the net, it fell to the goalkeepers. Kelleher found the top corner so it was substitute Kepa Arrizabalaga who suffered the shoot-out heartache on this occasion, as his shot went over the crossbar in sudden death.;','<img

        since our last game against Liverpool at the start of January, alongside Thiago Silva and Antonio Rudiger.;

        The Blues were disappointed not to be in the lead after just five minutes of play. Havertz charged into the
        middle of the pitch on the ball and fed a pass right to Azpilicueta, who delivered a low ball across goal
        towards Pulisic. Unfortunately the American, who had made an excellent run to get the chance, fired his shot too
        close to Kelleher in the Liverpool goal and Alonso couldnt keep his half-volley down on the rebound.;
        The momentum of the game was constantly shifting in an entertaining opening to the first half, with both teams
        alternating between enjoying spells of possession and trying to catch their opponents out on the counter.;
        Mane threatened to get free in the Chelsea penalty area a couple of times as he showed quick feet up against

The first game, at Anfield, we got a red card quite early in the game and from then on, we just had to take the point, Christensen recalls. In the second game we fought back [from 2-0 down] and I think we were unlucky not to win the game in the end.;

        earlier in his Chelsea career, which now spans 10 years.;

        Ive been here for so long and there have been a lot of different managers as well. Its hard as a young player
        to prove yourself all the time but coming from the Academy, people knew me so well and the last couple years has
        probably been where I should have been the whole time, at a constant level.;

        Thats probably my biggest flaw, that I wasnt consistent enough, but I feel like the last few seasons Ive got
        that and it has been a lot better, for me personally and just being a part of what we are trying to do now is
        great.;

        game he plays. He is a leader by example. Its super nice to have. He has collected so many trophies and had
        such an incredible career at this club.;

        He embodies everything Chelsea stands for: being relentless, being humble, but being a warrior at the same
        time. He deserves all these trophies. If you say how he protected Kai for the penalty, it was brilliant. This is
        what he does on a daily basis. He protects the team. He is the first one to step up, and Im happy to have him.;

        He is not because we have Mendy, and Edou is our number one. There is no need to change, but full credit to
        Kepa. He is an outstanding character and a fantastic team player. I have not experienced many players who have
        the capacity to cope with the situation like he did. In the end he comes out stronger from this situation than
        ever. Its very nice to see. I can only say thank you for how much he gives to the team.;

        It was an incredibly hard decision [to replace him last Saturday] because he was a huge part of the Club World

        thing if it was the other way around.;

        Bettinelli started his career at Fulham at the age of 14 and progressed through the ranks before making his club
        debut at the start of the 2014/15 season, following their relegation to the Championship.;

        Prior to that, he had spent time on loan in non-league with Dartford and in League Two at Accrington Stanley,
        gaining experience of senior football as a developing goalkeeper and winning the Young Player of the Year award
        at the Crown Ground.;

        Following the departure of David Stockdale in the summer of 2014, Bettinelli returned to the Cottage and
        established himself as Fulhams first-choice keeper, making 45 appearances in all competitions.;

        Despite starting 2015/16 as the clubs number one, the Londoner picked up a knee ligament injury in the third
        game of the campaign and was sidelined for seven months. He returned in March and was back between the posts for
        the final nine games of the season, though Fulhams promotion prospects continued to struggle as they finished
        the term 20th.;')

        first half of the season, both on the left and on the right of a back-three defence.;

        Rudiger scored his first Chelsea goal in a Carabao Cup win over Everton in October and his first in the Premier
        League was the only goal of the game when Swansea were defeated at Stamford Bridge the following month (below).
        Another headed goal followed in a big win over Stoke in the last game of 2017, but the German did have the

        December. By the end of the month he had regained fitness and form, featuring regularly for Frank Lampards side
        in the heart of the defence in the early stages of 2020.;

        Having played just 45 minutes of our first 24 matches of the season because if injury, he missed just one league
        game between his return and the suspension of football in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. His nous and

        Alonso made his Chelsea debut in a League Cup win at Leicester in September, and flourished the following month
        as left wing-back when Conte introduced a 3-4-3 system. The team went through October with a 100 per cent
        winning league record and no goals conceded and the good form continued into winter. He became the first player
        in English football league history to win his first 14 starts for one club, an ever-present in the run that did
        not end until we visited White Hart Lane at the start of 2017.;

        Alonso scored his first Chelsea goal in a fantastic team performance on Bonfire Night (5 November) when Everton
        were swept aside 5-0. He netted two in a win at Leicester in January and headed the important opener in an

        Chelsea appearance in a win at Brighton before Christmas.;

        Competing with a spot at left-back with Emerson Palmieri, Alonso made 39 appearances in total. He scored four
        goals, the last two proving particularly important: a late winner away to Slavia Prague in the Europa League

The England international joined us from Leicester City, the club where he began his professional career.','An England international who likes to attack from left-back, contributing with assists and the occasional goal, Chilwell is equally adept at the defensive side of the game. He is a modern full-back in every sense of the phrase, combining athleticism and energy up and down the flank with excellent technique and the ability to recover with pace in defensive transition.;
As the role of the full-back has evolved in recent years, Chilwell has emerged as a player who can contribute in every area of the field. His left-footedness provides balance to the team and his eagerness to attack is facilitated by being assured in possession and reliable with deliveries into the box or penetrative passes forward.','After a delayed start due to injury, Chilwells first season with Chelsea began with a bang on a brilliant debut
        as he quickly adapted to life at Stamford Bridge to become one of our best performers during the first part of
        the campaign.;

        He needed a second period of adaptation after our change of manager and system, but showed almost weekly
        improvement as he got to grips with the wing-back role and his importance to both Frank Lampard and Thomas
        Tuchel is demonstrated by the fact that only two outfield players started more Premier League games for Chelsea
        than Chilwell in 2020/21.

        Chilwell initially looked like one of those who could lose out from the introduction of Tuchel as head coach in
        January 2021, with Marcos Alonso returning to the team and the German preferring a back three with wing-backs, a
        system Chilwell had little experience of.;
        However, Tuchel was full of praise for the left-backs attitude when out of the team and his desire to improve in
        his potential new role. More importantly, when Chilwell was given his chance he took it, with impressive
        performances in back-to-back league games against Manchester United and Liverpool.;
        He also played his part in a tense finish to the season, setting up the winner at West Ham United that put us
        back in the top four with four games remaining, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League
        semi-finals and final, plus the FA Cup semi-final. The only disappointment was to have the icing on the cake
        snatched away from him, when his late equalising goal against his former club Leicester City in the FA Cup final
        was ruled out by VAR.;

As well as being blessed with pace and strength that make him a formidable opponent on the ground and in the air, being affectionately nicknamed The Monster by the Brazilian and French press, he has the composure and technical ability to play the ball out from centre-back and a wealth of experience at the highest level of football.

        By his own admission, Thiago Silvas introduction to Premier League football was tough. As captain, he made an
        individual mistake as West Brom built an unexpected 3-0 lead before half-time in our third league game of the
        season, before we fought back to draw 3-3.;

        However, that was more or less the only foot he put wrong all season. We conceded just twice in his next nine
        appearances across the Premier League and Champions League, with Thiago regularly holding the armband and even
        offering a threat in front of goal, netting emphatic headers against Sheffield United and West Ham United.;

        A tricky winter period ended when his old PSG boss Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard. After a pair of clean
        sheets in Tuchels first two games, Thiago Silva picked up a thigh injury in the third with us 1-0 up at Spurs.
        It ruled him out of action until April, when his return was marred by two yellow cards in quick succession
        against his unlikely bogey team West Brom.;

        He was soon back in the team and back to his very best, notably in the crucial 1-0 victory at West Ham, and then
        both legs of our Champions League semi-final tie with Real Madrid. His ability in and out of possession, and his
        reading of the game, stood out when it mattered most.;

        The final showdown with Manchester City in Porto, a city that means so much to Thiago Silva from his time
        playing there, began in heartbreaking fashion when he had to be replaced shortly before Kai Havertzs winner.;

        The groin injury may have ended his time on the pitch early, but it did not stop him celebrating a famous
        victory when the final whistle blew. After so many failed attempts at winning this competition during his years
        in Italy and France, he had succeeded at the first time of asking in England. He declared it a career highlight,
        and not long afterwards his contract at Chelsea was extended by one year.;')

        It was a good answer to some critics who had circled followed our disappointing away form and defending earlier
        in 2019, but Jorginho quickly displayed his mettle by playing the best football of his Chelsea career yet as the
        2018/19 campaign drew to a close.;

        He bounced back from missing a penalty in the Carabao Cup final (having scored in the successful semi-final
        shoot-out against Spurs) to convert from 12 yards against Eintracht Frankfurt as we booked our place in the

        (twice), and also displayed predatory instincts to equalise as we came from behind to win at Arsenal (above).;

        Many of our bright early-season performances owed a great deal to Jorginhos creativity and solidity in central
        midfield, with one stunning first-time assist for Tammy Abraham at Watford a real highlight. His link-up play
        with Mateo Kovacic also stood out.;

        When football was paused due to the Covid pandemic, Jorginho had only missed five Chelsea matches in all
        competitions. He spent a period out of the team when the Premier League returned three months later, but

        the first day of pre-season training, Mounts debut campaign as a scholar was a positive one.;

        He netted in our 5-1 win at Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup and played a pivotal role as a substitute in
        both the semi-final and final of our triumphant UEFA Youth League defence in April, setting up two goals in the
        3-0 last-four win over Anderlecht. Later in the week, he scored a crucial goal in the first leg of the Youth Cup

        2016/17 saw Mount establish himself as a regular with the development squad, scoring his first goal at that
        level against Liverpool in August. He also captained the Youth Cup side to a fourth consecutive success, netting
        a hat-trick in our fourth-round win at Birmingham. The midfielders eye-catching displays earned him plenty of
        admirers and he rounded off an impressive campaign by setting up the winner in the final as England won the
        Under-19 European Championship.;
        After going to the European Under-21 Championship with England in the summer of 2019, Mount returned to Chelsea
        and signed a new five-year contract.;

        He started the season in the team under Frank Lampard, making his Chelsea debut and impressing against
        Manchester United despite an eventual heavy defeat. He marked his first appearance at the Bridge by opening the
        scoring early on, and he followed up that maiden strike with another away to Norwich the following weekend.;

        He went into the lockdown period when that season was interrupted in good form after opening the scoring in our
        last match in March against Everton, and showed plenty of end product when football resumed three months later.
        In particular his performance on the last day of the Premier League caught the eye, as he scored one and set up
        the other in the 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers which secured our Champions League qualification.;

        His goal against Wolves was a pinpoint free-kick, underlining the threat he carries from set-pieces, which also
        accounted for half of his six assists. With eight goals to his name too, only three Chelsea players were
        directly involved in more goals than Mount in 2019/20, and his 53 appearances in all competitions made him the
        first Academy graduate to play more than 50 games in his debut season with the senior side.;')

        made 12 appearances for the Blues in his first season, mainly as a substitute. He was also part of the group
        which travelled to Munich for our maiden Champions League triumph, although he wasnt named in the matchday
        squad for the shoot-out win over Bayern Munich.;

        The Belgian made three appearances from the bench before heading out on loan in August 2013, in the Premier

        game of his second spell with Chelsea, setting us on our way to a 2-0 victory at Arsenal in the Premier League,
        before fulfilling his childhood dream of scoring at Stamford Bridge by getting a brace in his first home game
        since returning, as we defeated Aston Villa 3-0. Another goal in the Champions League win over Zenit St
        Petersburg made it four goals in as many matches after rejoining the Blues.;

        However, the goals didnt keep coming quite so easily and an injury picked up while scoring in the return match
        against Zenit in Russia saw him ruled out during a crucial period in December. Lukaku got important goals in
        back-to-back games on his return, giving us the lead in the 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Boxing Day and opening the
        scoring in the 1-1 draw with Brighton that followed.;

        It was in the FIFA Club World Cup that Lukaku had arguably the biggest impact of his first six months back with
        Chelsea, as we lifted the trophy for the first-ever time in Abu Dhabi. He showed a predators instincts to slot
        in the only goal of the semi-final with Al Hilal from close range, before an excellent header from Callum
        Hudson-Odois cross opened the scoring in the final, as we beat Brazilian side Palmeiras in extra time.;

        days later as we were beaten by Liverpool on penalties in the Super Cup. He set up Olivier Girouds opener and
        had a goal of his own ruled out for offside.;

        He started our next three leagues games before losing his place in the team for a while. Following the October
        international break, he played decisive passes in tight wins over Newcastle and Ajax having been brought off the
        bench. He was rewarded with a start at Burnley in our next league outing and responded in style, scoring a

        Full of confidence and incisiveness, Pulisics knack for scoring or setting up goals showed no sign of
        relenting, as he displayed predatory instincts to net in wins over Watford and Crystal Palace. His dribbling
        skills also earned us a penalty in the 4-4 epic against Ajax and his first Champions League goal for the club
        helped secure a crucial draw at Valencia.;

        He had become a regular in the starting line-up by the end of 2019, but a combination of injury and the
        suspension of football during the Covid-19 pandemic meant he didnt play between New Years Day and the first
        game of the restart in mid-June. His form was worth the wait, though, as he opened the scoring in our first two
        games of the restart, wins over Aston Villa and Manchester City.;

        He finished his first campaign in England as arguably Chelsea and the Premier Leagues form player, underlined
        when he became the first American to score in an FA Cup final as he again got the first goal of the game,
        against Arsenal at Wembley. However, an injury meant an early end to his match and we struggled to maintain the

        pitch throughout 2020/21, scoring more goals and providing more assists than any other Chelsea player in all
        competitions, while only Mason Mount made more appearances. He could also count himself unlucky that those
        figures werent even higher, as his five shots against the woodwork and two goals ruled out by VAR were also the
        most for the Blues.;

        On his fourth appearance for Chelsea, he endeared himself to the fans by scoring his first goal for the club
        against London rivals Tottenham with a sharp turn and finish, and that started an impressive run of eight goals
        in just nine games, including two braces and starring roles in the big Champions League wins over Krasnodar and
        Rennes.;

        His best was saved for the Premier League, though, when he fired us into a two-goal lead against Southampton and

By that stage Havertz had become one of German footballs highest-rated young players following his breakthrough at Bayer Leverkusen, setting a series of records for his achievements, including those for the youngest player to make 50 and 100 Bundesliga appearances, which were both previously held by Werner.;

Tall (he is 6ft 2in), fast and technically excellent, he has shown impressive versatility given his age. Predominantly an attacking midfielder known for his accurate and incisive passing, along with an ability to retain possession in tight spaces and win the ball back in advanced positions, Havertz can also play out wide or in a central striking postion. He has been dubbed an Alleskonner in his homeland – meaning a player who can do everything.;

        tactical flexibility, especially under Thomas Tuchel in the latter stages of 2020/21, in addition to his
        combined 20 goals and assists, becoming most obvious at the business end of our triumphant Champions League
        campaign against Real Madrid and Manchester City.;

        Despite only joining Chelsea 10 days before the first game of our season, leaving him with very little in the
        way of a pre-season, Havertz went straight into Frank Lampards line-up to face Brighton on the opening day.;

        He started nine of our first 10 games in all competitions in a hugely promising start to his Blues career. That
        included a starring role in our Champions League win at Krasnodar, but the undoubted highlight came in the
